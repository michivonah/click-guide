# click-guide
![](/logo/github-banner.png)
A browser add-on which records the steps clicked on a page and generates a easy to understand guide from it.

Similar to tango.us/dubble.so/folge.me/magichow.co but all local - no data leaves your device

## To-Do MVP:
- [x] identify element selector or id
- [x] create a screenshot of the steps
- [x] ability to save multiple steps
- [x] export guide as json file
- [x] add recording start/stop functionality
- [x] create basic popup UI

### Additional nice to have:
- [x] Meta data in guide (title, description, author, date)
- [x] Viewer for Guide JSON
    - [x] PDF export
    - [ ] automatic file loading (url parameter/etc)
    - [ ] removing of steps
    - [ ] reordering steps
    - [ ] add marker on step image (#4)
- [x] Editor for Guide
- [x] improve error handling
- [ ] Blur sensitive information
- [x] Pause/resume recording feature
- [ ] fix open issues

### Maybe far in the future:
- [ ] Optional cloud for sharing guide as link
